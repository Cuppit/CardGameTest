Decided to make the main game loop happen within the scene "GameBoard",
which contains a camera for the player, an instance of a "middle board"
UI which holds the monsters on the board, and the two decks, and
additional instances of each player UI.  They will be pre-defined,
and turned on/off based on how many players are in the game.

After some reflection on the degree of progress, and the lack of vision
on how to complete the game, and the fact that cards aren't properly
defined/structured, it may be time to start from scratch with a more
robust plan.  

IF STOP NOW, WHERE DID EVERYTHING GO WRONG?

lessons learned:
	-Need clearer vision/stronger understanding of UI elements
