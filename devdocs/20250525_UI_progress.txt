WHERE TO GO

Working on a decent mock-up of the player UI, so to have something to work with.


14:36 CDT

Some time put into working on it, got a half-way decent mock-up of a player UI.
Next:
	-Tie each instance of PlayerUI with an instance of the underlying script

Took a break around 15:00, got back to it...except...

...I didn't actually get back to it.  Until now.  Tasks in mind:
	-Store player state (cards in hand, on field, etc.)
	-Set up game flow from start to end
	-Make UI decisions for how to implement gameplay
	
	PROBLEM: STATE MANAGEMENT
	I don't actually know how to build an FSM, which I'm assuming is what I need
	to manage the game state.

Spent some time pen-and-papering flowchart for game state, will implement at a later date
