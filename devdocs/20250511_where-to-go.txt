WHERE DO WE GO WITH THIS?

To develop a generic card game engine where a card game can be created and put into it.

WHAT ARE YOU ACTUALLY TRYING TO DO AND WHY?

I wanna make a Dice Throne simulator, but also I want to make a digital version of some of the games by Unstable Games, such as "Here to Slay".

WHY?

I want to demonstrate, empirically, why it's a bad idea to simply ignore one of the core mechanics of the game, namely, that one of the win conditions is assembling a full party!

HOW?

Here's the plan:
	-adadpt the turn-tracking mechanism that was developed in the Blackjack engine developed a few weeks ago
	-Figure out how to store cards in some kind of database format (json? castledb?)
		-OTHER TOOL: card editor program??
			-card properties
				-card name
				-card type
				-card text
				-card rules/mechanics/effects
				-card art

Let's start small.  How do you adapt "Here to Slay"?

no.  Better question: how is the game state managed in the Blackjack example?

ANSWER:  There are four states, "Betting", "Player_turn", "Dealer_turn", and "Game_over".   

Q: So a method of managing states was necessary to make Blackjack work.  How do you adapt that to the game "Here to Slay"?

A: You need to break down mechanically what the game states are, and you can only do that by considering the rules of the game. 

Q: WHAT DO THE RULES SAY?
A: Let's review
	OBJECTIVE: Defeat 3 monsters | OR | assemble a *full party*.

-----------------------

GAME PROCEDURE

SETUP

all players choose a party leader (order in which players are allowed to choose is random)

each player is dealt 5 cards from the main deck

the monster card deck is shuffled, 3 are drawn and placed in the middle of the play area.

begin each players first turn, starting with the player who picked his or her party leader first.

==TURN PROCESS==

-Player receives 3 action points

Player chooses from the following options:
	-(1 AP) draw a card from the main deck

	-(1 AP) attempt to play a hero, item, or magic card 
		==CHALLENGES CHECK==
		-All other players are given a chance to play a challenge card (starting with the player whose turn is after the current player)
			-If another player challenges the card, challenge commences and rolls are made (any players that already decided whether to challenge will be given another opportunity to challenge after this resolves).
				==ROLL MODIFIERS CHECK==
				-All players in sequence are prompted with the opportunity to play a modifier (starting with the player whose turn is after the current player) 
					-if a player plays a modifier, all players in sequence will be prompted again with an opportunity to play a modifier (starting with the player after the player who just played a modifier)
				-once all players have opted not to play a modifier, the challenge is resolved.
				
				-if challenger's final roll result is equal to or higher than the opponents, the challenge is successful, and the hero/item/magic card played is discarded and has no effect.
		-If no challenges were successful, the effect of the card happens
		-if *hero*, player may also roll to use that hero's ability

	-(1 AP) roll two dice to activate an effect of a hero card in your party (See "ROLL MODIFIERS CHECK" above for resolving a roll)
	-(2 AP) ATTACK a monster card (Can only choose this for a monster for which your party meets the requirements)
		-Roll to see outcome of the attack (see "ROLL MODIFIERS CHECK" above for resolving a roll)
		-If attack successfully SLAYs a monster, check if its' the 3rd monster the player has slain.  If so, END GAME (player wins!)
	-(3 AP) DISCARD every card in your hand (if you have any) and DRAW five new cards

Player repeatedly chooses actions until:
	-No more AP
	-Chooses not to use an action

At the end of the turn, check the player's party status.  If it's complete, END GAME (player wins!)

Alright, so that's simple enough to outline.  How is that modelled in Godot?

Better question, what does the UI look like?

Did a mock-up of the player area in ms paint, "Player UI.png".

How should the game seem...

There needs to be a way to construct a scene

IMAGINE JUST A 2-PLAYER GAME, WHERE BOTH PLAYERS BOARDS WILL FIT IN ONE VIEW

After staring at an attempt at putting together a "player UI" scene, I realize I haven't figured out *what* exactly it is in the context of the game at large.  So here we go:
player_ui.tscn

WHAT?
A UI which displays the board for a specific player

HOW?
The PlayerUI on creation is given reference to a "player" object by the game manager scene, which holds all the properties of the player

SO WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS THE "GAME" SCENE

Time's been squandered, and the day is over.  Will have to pick up at a future time
